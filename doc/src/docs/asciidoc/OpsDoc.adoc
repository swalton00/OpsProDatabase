:description: documentation for the Ops Car program

== Introduction

The Ops Car Progress program is a tool to record (in a database)
by running it at intervals as trains are moved by the JMRI OpsPro
program. The Ops Car Progress program (hereafter referred to as
OpsCar) reads the JMRI OpsPro files and read them in the database.
The next time the programd is run, it will record the location of
cars at that point. You can then look at the position of each car
at each of the two points. Or, you can look at which cars at
each location. Each execution of the OpCar program will create
another set of records of cars and locations. Ideally, you would
run the OpsCar program each tie you terminate a train in JMRI OpsPro.
That would give you a way to track the movement of cars to ensure
that the cars are moving the way you want them.
