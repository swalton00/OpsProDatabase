:description: documentation for the Ops Car program

== Introduction

The Ops Car Progress program is a tool to record (in a database)
by running it at intervals as trains are moved by the JMRI OpsPro
program. The Ops Car Progress program (hereafter referred to as
OpsCar) reads the JMRI OpsPro files and read them in the database.
The next time the programd is run, it will record the location of
cars at that point. You can then look at the position of each car
at each of the two points. Or, you can look at which cars at
each location. Each execution of the OpCar program will create
another set of records of cars and locations. Ideally, you would
run the OpsCar program each tie you terminate a train in JMRI OpsPro.
That would give you a way to track the movement of cars to ensure
that the cars are moving the way you want them.

When first run the program there are a number of fields 
that you must fill out before you can actually collect data.
Several of the fields (Userid, password and Schema) are items
that you simply pick a value for, enter them, and then, 
once the program uses them, they are fixed.
One value (Operations Home) depends on where JMRI profile 
operations director is located.
Only the database information is complex and there are

== Installation

There is no installation process. Simply extract the files
contained in the distribution zip to an empty folder.
On Windows, this should *not* be in
the Windows "Program Files" folder 
(Windows makes this Read Only and the program 
needs to write a log file to record what it has done.
Change to the "bin" folder inside the resulting structure and
execute either the "Ops_pro_car_progress.bat" or the
"Ops_pro_car_progress" depending on your operating system
(.bat for Windows, the other for Unix or Mac).

This program requires Java, at least at version 11, but supports up
to 21. This is the same as the JMRI requirement.

There are several values that must be entered the first time you
run the program. When you run the program for the first time, you
will see the following dialog. The various fields must be filled in
and saved before you can continue (unless you exit).

==== Userid

The Userid field (labeled "A" in the image above) will become the userid
for the database. 
This first time you connect to the database, this will become
the password, so it can be anything you want.
If you won't be interacting with database except through
this application, this field is not that important, but it must have a value.
You can use any value you want, but it should start with a letter, consist
of letters, numbers and perhaps an underscore. There is no specific length
requirement, but you should keep it relatively short. If you will be
interacting with the database with another tool, you should keep track of
this (and the following) values.

==== Password

The password field ("B" above) is another required field. This value
is case dependent. The information will be shown as asterisks as you
enter it.

WARNING: This field is stored in unencrypted form! Do not use the
password from any other system here. There is no security risk with
this password since the data is not financially important and the database
will be not be shared on the intern

==== Schema

Another required field (labeled "C"). It should start with a letter and
contain only letters, numbers, and possibly underscores. This will
be used to qualify the data in the database.

==== Operations Home

The location of the OpPro data. Either enter it in the field labeled "D",
or use the the "Select Operations Home" button to find the correct
location. This button will open a file chooser dialog which
will allow you to select the "operations" directory of your
JMRI installation. This directory will typically contain a
number of files beginning with "Operations" and ending with ".xml" (you
might not see the ending, depending on your operating system settings).
This directory is in the location chosen
